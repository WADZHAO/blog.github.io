# Basic Description
<p>There are all the files I created in order to build the <a href="https://codewithcolt-ian1994.c9users.io/blogs">blog app</a>.</p>
<p>I built it by using <strong>RESTful routing</strong>, <strong>node.js</strong>, and <strong>Semantic UI (for CSS styling)</strong>.</p>
<p>This app is running on my <strong>AWS Cloud 9 server</strong>.</p>
<p>If the server is not started when you are trying to access the blog, please contact me at YMZhao23@outlook.com.</p>
