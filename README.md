# Basic Description
<p>There are all the files I created to build the <a href="https://codewithcolt-ian1994.c9users.io/blogs">blog app</a>.</p>
<p>I built it by using <strong>RESTful routing</strong>, <strong>node.js</strong>, and <strong>Semantic UI (for CSS styling)</strong>.</p>
<p>This app is ran on my <strong>AWS Cloud 9 server</strong>.</p>
